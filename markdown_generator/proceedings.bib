 abstract = {This paper studies the problem of graph-level clustering, which is a novel yet challenging task. This problem is critical in a variety of real-world applications such as protein clustering and genome analysis in bioinformatics. Recent years have witnessed the success of deep clustering coupled with graph neural networks (GNNs). However, existing methods focus on clustering among nodes given a single graph, while exploring clustering on multiple graphs is still under-explored. In this paper, we propose a general graph-level clustering framework},

 abstract = {Rubbing restorations are significant for preserving world cultural history. In this paper, we propose the RubbingGAN model for restoring incomplete rubbing characters. Specifically, we collect characters from the Zhang Menglong Bei and build up the first rubbing restoration dataset. We design the first generative adversarial network for rubbing restoration. Based on the dataset we collect, we apply the RubbingGAN to learn the Zhang Menglong Bei font style and restore the characters. The results of experiments show that RubbingGAN can repair},

 abstract = {Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a framework enabling large language models (LLMs) to enhance their accuracy and reduce hallucinations by integrating external knowledge bases. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid RAG system enhanced through a comprehensive suite of optimizations that significantly improve retrieval quality, augment reasoning capabilities, and refine numerical computation ability. We refined the text chunks and tables in web pages, added attribute predictors to reduce hallucinations, conducted},
